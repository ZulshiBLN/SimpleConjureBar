# A release needs its CHANGELOG entry dated: the heading of the TOC's version
# must read "## [x.y.z] - YYYY-MM-DD". The zip ships the CHANGELOG and a
# release cannot be withdrawn, so "Unreleased" is refused before anything is
# published (code review 1.1.0, F-12).

# Usage: check-changelog-heading.sh <version> <CHANGELOG.md>
