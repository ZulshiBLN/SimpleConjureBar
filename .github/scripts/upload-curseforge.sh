# Uploads a checked release zip to CurseForge, filed under WoW Forever. The
# endpoint and payload are the BigWigs packager's (upload_curseforge at the
# pinned commit); the packager uploads only a zip it builds in the same run,
# so the checks could not come before its upload.
#
# Usage: upload-curseforge.sh [--dry-run] <zip> <notes.md>
# The token comes from CF_API_TOKEN and is never printed.
# --dry-run resolves the game version and builds the payload, uploads nothing;
# without a token it takes the version from the TOC and the ID 0.
# For the CI controls only, with --dry-run: CF_VERSIONS_FILE replaces the
# site's version list, GAME_VERSION the version the TOC asks for.
