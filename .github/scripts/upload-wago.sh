# Uploads a checked release zip to Wago, filed under WoW Forever. The endpoint
# and payload are the BigWigs packager's (upload_wago at the pinned commit);
# the packager uploads only a zip it builds in the same run, so the checks
# could not come before its upload.
#
# Usage: upload-wago.sh [--dry-run] <zip> <notes.md>
# The token comes from WAGO_API_TOKEN and is never printed.
# --dry-run resolves the game version and builds the payload, uploads nothing.
# Wago's version list is public, so a dry run needs no token.
# For the CI controls only, with --dry-run: WAGO_VERSIONS_FILE replaces the
# site's version list, GAME_VERSION the version the TOC asks for.
